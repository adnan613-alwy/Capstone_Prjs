## Phase 1: Setup & Forking

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Go to [This Repo](https://github.com/Zambagarrah/Capstone_Prjs)
   - Fork your branch i.e the one with your name **DON'T FORK THE MAIN BRANCH/ SOMEONE ELSE'S BRANCH**. (If your name isn't on the branch list contact me)
  
2. **Clone Your Fork Locally**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-FORKED-REPO.git
   cd YOUR-FORKED-REPO
   ```
   
## Phase 2: HTML & CSS Foundation

1. **Create Your Project Structure**
   ```Code
   /portfolio
    ├── index.html
    ├── script.js
    ├── styles/
    │   └── main.css
    └── assets/
        ├── icons/
        └── images/```

2. **Start with HTML**
  - Build your homepage (index.html).
  - Include sections like:
      > About Me.
      > Projects.
      > Contact Info.
      > Fun Facts or Hobbies.
  
3. **Style with CSS**
  - Link your main.css file
  - Use Flexbox or Grid for layout
  - Choose a color palette that reflects your personality
  - Commit Often
    > Example commit messages:
    ```
    feat: added About Me section with placeholder text
    style: applied flexbox layout to project cards```

## Phase 3: JavaScript Enhancements (As You Learn)

1. **Add Interactivity**
  - Buttons that toggle content
  - Light/dark mode switch
  - Form validation for contact section

2. **Organize Your JS**

  ```Code
  /portfolio
    ├── scripts/
    │   └── main.js
  ```
3. **Progressive Enhancement**
  - Don’t wait to be perfect; add features as you learn
  - Document what you plan to add in future commits

## Phase 4: Updates, Feedback & Showcase

1. **Push Regularly**

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat: added responsive navbar"
  git push origin your-branch-name
```

2. **Peer Review**
- Share your branch with classmates or mentors
- Ask for feedback on design, layout, and code clarity

3. **Prepare for Showcase**
  - Add a README to your portfolio folder explaining your design choices
  - Include screenshots or a Loom video walkthrough

## Final Tips & Recommendations

  - **Use Semantic HTML:** `<header>, <main>, <footer>` help with accessibility and SEO.
  - **Mobile First:** Test your site on phones and tablets.
  - **Keep It Personal:** Add your favorite quote, a fun animation, or a local touch.
  - **Document Your Journey:** Use commit messages and comments to explain your learning.
  - **Celebrate Progress:** Every update is a win—track your growth!
